        "1.  What is the difference between interpreted and compiled languages?\n",
        "- Interpreted languages run the code line by line, using an interpreter.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Compiled languages first translate the whole code into machine language (binary) before running.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  What is exception handling in Python?\n",
        "- Exception handling in Python is a way to deal with errors in your program without crashing it.\n",
        "\n",
        "In Easy Words:\n",
        "Sometimes, something goes wrong in a program — like dividing by zero or opening a missing file.\n",
        "Instead of stopping the program, Python lets you handle the error using:\n",
        "\n",
        "try: Code that might cause an error\n",
        "\n",
        "except: Code that runs if there’s an error\n",
        "\n",
        "finally: (Optional) Code that always runs\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling?\n",
        "- The finally block in Python is used to write code that will always run, no matter what happens—whether there’s an error or not.\n",
        "\n",
        " Purpose of finally:\n",
        "To clean up resources like closing a file or disconnecting from a database\n",
        "\n",
        "To make sure important steps are always completed, even if there's an error\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is logging in Python?\n",
        "- Logging in Python means keeping a record of events that happen when your code runs. It helps in tracking bugs, understanding program flow, and debugging errors—especially in large programs\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "- The __del__ method in Python is a special method called a destructor. Its main purpose is to define what should happen when an object is deleted or destroyed.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. What is the difference between import and from ... import in Python?\n",
        "- In Python, both import and from ... import are used to include external modules in your code, but they work a bit differently:\n",
        "\n",
        "import statement:\n",
        "It imports the entire module.\n",
        "\n",
        "You have to use the module name every time you access something from it.\n",
        "\n",
        "from ... import statement:\n",
        "It imports specific parts (like functions, classes, variables) from a module.\n",
        "\n",
        "You can use them directly without the module name.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. How can you handle multiple exceptions in Python?\n",
        "- In Python, multiple exceptions can be handled using multiple except blocks. Each except block can catch a specific type of exception and respond accordingly. This allows a program to manage different error conditions in a structured way.\n",
        "\n",
        "8.  What is the purpose of the with statement when handling files in Python?\n",
        "- The with statement is used to handle files safely and automatically in Python. It ensures that the file is properly opened and automatically closed after its block of code runs — even if an error occurs.\n",
        "\n",
        "This makes the code cleaner and prevents issues like forgetting to close the file.\n",
        "\n",
        "9.  What is the difference between multithreading and multiprocessing?\n",
        "- Multithreading is when a program runs multiple tasks (threads) at the same time within the same process. They share memory and are best for tasks like downloading files or reading data while doing other work.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Multiprocessing is when a program runs multiple tasks using separate processes. Each process has its own memory. It’s better for tasks that need a lot of CPU power like data analysis or image processing.\n",

        "10. What are the advantages of using logging in a program?\n",
        "- Advantages of Using Logging in a Program:\n",

        "Offers more control, like setting log levels (info, warning, error).\n",

        "Logs can be stored in files, which is useful for long-term monitoring.\n",

        "- Memory management in Python is the process of handling the allocation and deallocation of memory automatically while the program runs. Python manages memory using:\n",
        "\n",
        "Automatic Garbage Collection – Unused memory is freed automatically.\n",
        "\n",
        "Reference Counting – Python keeps track of how many references exist for each object. When the count reaches zero, memory is released.\n",
        "\n",
        "Memory Pools – Python uses private memory pools (like the PyMalloc allocator) for efficient memory usage.\n",
        "\n",
        "In short, Python takes care of memory in the background so you can focus on writing code.\n",
        "\n",
        "12.  What are the basic steps involved in exception handling in Python?\n",
        "- Steps in Exception Handling in Python:\n",
        "Try Block:\n",
        "Write the code that might cause an error inside the try block.\n",
        "\n",
        "Except Block:\n",
        "Handle the error using the except block. You can catch specific exceptions or use a general one.\n",
        "\n",
        "Else Block (optional):\n",
        "Code in else runs if no error occurs in the try block.\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally Block (optional):\n",
        "This block runs no matter what — error or no error. Used for cleanup actions like closing files.\n",

        "\n",
        "Garbage Collector (GC):\n",
        "\n",
        "Python also has a garbage collector to detect cyclic references (when objects reference each other and are no longer reachable).\n",

        "\n",
